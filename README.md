# Deep Speaker from Baidu Research -  Pytorch Implementation 

> This project is forked from the [qqueing/DeepSpeaker-pytorch](https://github.com/qqueing/DeepSpeaker-pytorch). Parts of code was modified for the server to process. And some module will be added in the future.

This is a slightly modified pytorch implementation of the model(modified Resnet + triplet loss) presented by Baidu Research in [Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02304.pdf).

This code was tested using Voxceleb database. [Voxceleb database paper](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2017/Nagrani17/nagrani17.pdf) shows shows 7.8% EER using CNN. But in my code can't reach that point.
This code contained a lot of editable point such as preprocessing, model, scoring(length nomalization and file processing) and etc.

I hope this code helps researcher reach higher score.

Also, use the part of code:
- [liorshk's git repository](https://github.com/liorshk/facenet_pytorch)
   - Baseline code - Facenet pytorch implimetation
- [hbredin's git repository](https://github.com/hbredin/pyannote-db-voxceleb)
   - Voxceleb Database reader


## Features
 - In test, length normalization
   - This means extracting many input from single wave and averaging. This makes the results slightly better.
 - In training, except pandas and preloading list. 
   - This makes different training accuracy each epoch, but it does not matter.

## To do list
Work accomplished so far:
- [x] Model implementation
- [x] Data pipeline implementation - "Voxceleb"(Please note:Pytorch dataloader is so weak(High-load preprocessing and many thread))

- [ ] Code cleanup
- [ ] Modified preprocessing
- [ ] Modified model
- [ ] Modified scoring
